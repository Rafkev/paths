# paths
A JS Shortest path algorithms to find the complex shortest path between two nodes in graphs.
This script defines a Graph class with methods to add vertices and edges, as well as an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in the dijkstra method. It finds the shortest distances from a specified start vertex to all other vertices in the graph. You can customize the graph by adding vertices and edges according to your requirements.
